# Harry potter has got n number of apples. Harry has some students among whom, he wants to distribute the apples. These n number of apples are provided to harry by his friends and he can request for few more or few less apples.
#
# You need to print whether a number in range mn to mx is a divisor of n or not.
#
# Input:
# Take input n, mn and mx from the user
#
# Output:
# Print whether the numbers between mn and mx are divisor of n or not. If mn = mx, show that this is not a range and mn is equal to mx. Show the result for that number
#
# Example:
# If n is 20 and mn=2 and mx = 5
#
# 2 is a divisor of 20
#
# 3 is not a divisor of 20
#
# â€¦
#
# 5 is a divisor of 20

apples = int(input("Enter the number of apples\n"))
mn = int(input("Enter the minimum number to check\n"))
mx = int(input("Enter the maximum number to check\n"))

for i in range(mn, mx+1):    # mx+1 bcoz exactly us number tak janne ke liye
    if apples%i == 0:
        print(f"{i} is a divisor of {apples}")
    else:
        print(f"{i} is not a divisor of {apples}")
