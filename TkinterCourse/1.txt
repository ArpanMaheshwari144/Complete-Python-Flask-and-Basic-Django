India are scheduled to visit Australia for a series at the end of this year. Recently, when speaking about the series, Australia batsman Matthew Wade said that he would not be indulging in any verbal conversations with India captain Virat Kohli and the rest of the Indian team as it might spur them on. Wade has used sharp words to get into the skin of his opponents in the past, especially in the 2017 India ODI series and also during last year’s Ashes.
