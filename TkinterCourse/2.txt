Ranveer said in a statement, “I am a 90’s kid. Born in 1985, 90s era is what defines me. Following everything from movies, music, pop culture, fashion and those are my formative years. Whatever you subscribe to, stays with you forever. I remember watching Zabaan Sambhalke, Dekh Bhai Dekh. Basically, I am TV ka bachcha, a product of television, a TV kid. When kids were outside, I was in front of the idiot box!”
