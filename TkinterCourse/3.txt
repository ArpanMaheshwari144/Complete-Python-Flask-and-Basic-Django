Radhe, directed by Prabhudheva, is his foremost priority, reported Mid-Day. "First, Salman will film the Radhe song with Disha Patani. The number was originally supposed to be shot in Azerbaijan, but now they will film it in a studio. Some patchwork shoot is pending as well. The makers are eyeing a Diwali release," said a source close to Khan's family.
